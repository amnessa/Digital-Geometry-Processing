## Major Fixes Applied to Segmentation System

### 1. CORRECTED RIGIDITY FORMULA
**Before**: `ξ = (λ₁ + λ₂ + λ₃) / max(λ₁, λ₂, λ₃)` → gave values > 1.0
**After**: `ξ = λ₁ / (λ₁ + λ₂ + λ₃)` → gives values in [0.33, 1.0] as expected

**Expected behavior**:
- ξ ≈ 1.0 = rigid skeletal segments (limbs)
- ξ ≈ 0.33 = non-rigid junction points (shoulders, hips, etc.)
- Threshold ~0.9 should now work as intended

### 2. IMPROVED ISOCURVE EXTRACTION
**Before**: Simple vertex search with tolerance → only found 4 bracelets
**After**: True triangle marching algorithm → finds proper continuous isocurves

**Triangle marching benefits**:
- Finds exact edge intersections using linear interpolation
- Creates continuous curves by connecting adjacent triangles
- Much more isocurves extracted per harmonic field

### 3. ENHANCED RIGIDITY ANALYSIS GENERATES MORE SKELETAL SEGMENTS
**Before**: Only used first 2 FPS points → 1 segment → ~4 nodes
**After**: Uses up to 10 FPS point pairs → 10 segments → 50+ nodes

### 4. CORRECTED THRESHOLD RANGES
**Before**: Suggested 0.85-1.05 range (too narrow for old formula)
**After**: Suggests 0.4-1.0 range (appropriate for corrected formula)

## Expected Test Results:
Run: Load man0.off → Option 10 (Enhanced Rigidity) → Option 12 (Interactive Testing)

**Rigidity values should now be**: [0.33, 1.0] range
**Threshold ~0.9**: Should show meaningful junction detection
**Threshold ~0.8**: Should show more junction candidates
**Threshold ~0.95**: Should show only the most obvious junctions

## Test Plan:
1. Load man0.off
2. Run Enhanced Rigidity Analysis (option 10)
3. Check rigidity range is now [~0.33, ~1.0]
4. Use Interactive Testing (option 12) with thresholds 0.8, 0.9, 0.95
5. Should see meaningful variation in junction detection
