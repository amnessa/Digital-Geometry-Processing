Of course. Extracting isocurves is a fundamental process in geometry processing. The high-level summary is that you "march" through the triangles of the mesh, find where the desired isovalue crosses the triangle's edges, and connect these intersection points.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the most common method, which relies on linear interpolation as mentioned in your implementation plan.

### **The Goal**

Given a mesh where every vertex `i` has a scalar value `f(i)` (from the harmonic field), and a specific isovalue `v` (e.g., 0.5), we want to find the continuous line on the mesh surface where the function's value is exactly `v`.

Since the function is only known at the vertices, we make a key assumption: **the function value changes linearly along each edge of the mesh**.

### **The Algorithm: Marching Through Triangles**

The algorithm processes one triangle at a time. For a given triangle with vertices `v_1`, `v_2`, `v_3` and their corresponding harmonic values `f_1`, `f_2`, `f_3`:

**Step 1: Classify Vertices**
For each vertex, check if its function value is above or below the isovalue `v`. This tells you which side of the curve the vertex is on.

**Step 2: Find Intersected Edges**
An isocurve will cross an edge if and only if one vertex of the edge is "above" `v` and the other is "below". You check the three edges of the triangle:

  * Edge (v\_1, v\_2): Does `v` lie between `f_1` and `f_2`?
  * Edge (v\_2, v\_3): Does `v` lie between `f_2` and `f_3`?
  * Edge (v\_3, v\_1): Does `v` lie between `f_3` and `f_1`?

A triangle will either have **zero** intersected edges (the curve doesn't pass through it) or **two** intersected edges (the curve passes through it as a line segment).

**Step 3: Calculate Intersection Points via Linear Interpolation**
For each of the two intersected edges, you calculate the precise 3D point of intersection. If edge (v\_1, v\_2) is intersected, the intersection point `P` is a weighted average of the vertex positions:

$$P = \frac{v - f_1}{f_2 - f_1} \cdot v_2 + \frac{f_2 - v}{f_2 - f_1} \cdot v_1$$

This formula can be simplified. Let `t = (v - f_1) / (f_2 - f_1)`. Then the point `P` is:

$$P = (1-t) \cdot v_1 + t \cdot v_2$$

This gives you the 3D coordinates for the two points where the isocurve enters and exits the triangle.

*Inside a single triangle, vertices are classified (blue \> v, white \< v). The two intersected edges are identified. The intersection points (red dots) are calculated using linear interpolation, and the line segment connecting them forms the piece of the isocurve in that triangle.*

**Step 4: Form a Line Segment**
The two intersection points you calculated in Step 3 form a single line segment. This segment is the part of the isocurve that lies within the current triangle.

**Step 5: Connect Segments to Form the Full Curve**
You repeat this process for every triangle in the mesh. This will give you a large collection of small line segments. To form the final, continuous isocurves, you need to connect them.

This is straightforward because each intersection point on an edge is shared by the two triangles adjacent to that edge. You can use a graph-based approach:

1.  Pick an arbitrary segment to start.
2.  Go to one of its endpoints. This point lies on a mesh edge. Find the other triangle that shares this edge.
3.  That other triangle must have generated a segment that also uses this exact same endpoint. Find this "neighbor" segment.
4.  Connect your first segment to the neighbor segment.
5.  Continue this process, "walking" from triangle to triangle, until you get back to your starting point (forming a closed loop) or reach the boundary of the mesh.

The final result of this process for a single isovalue `v` will be one or more polylines, which are your extracted isocurves. To get the `K=50` isocurves required by the algorithm, you simply run this entire procedure 50 times with different isovalues (e.g., v = 0.02, 0.04, ..., 1.0).
