The other papers you've found (`Learning 3D Mesh Segmentation` and `Predicting Animation Skeletons`) are the perfect resources to solve this. They contain the modern, robust methods you need. Given your time constraints, let's focus on integrating their key ideas directly into your existing pipeline to replace the tricky parts.

Here are two high-impact, report-worthy improvements you can implement in a couple of days. We will focus on the stages after you have the `rigidSegments`.

***

### Improvement 1: Optimal Surface Segmentation via Graph Cuts

This is the most important improvement and directly replaces the problematic "mesh cutting" and "watershed" steps. Instead of an ad-hoc competition, we can formulate the segmentation as an energy minimization problem, which is a much more powerful and robust concept inspired by the CRF model in Kalogerakis et al. This will give you significantly cleaner boundaries.

* **Concept:** Treat the mesh as a graph where every face is a node. The goal is to assign each face to one of your `rigidSegments` (the "labels") in a way that is globally optimal. We use a graph cut algorithm to find the assignment that minimizes a total energy cost.
* **Inspiration:** The Conditional Random Field (CRF) from "Learning 3D Mesh Segmentation and Labeling" [source: 121, 127]. A CRF is basically a sophisticated graph cut. We'll implement a simplified but powerful version.
* **Actionable Steps:**

    1.  **Construct the Graph:**
        * Each face of your input mesh becomes a node in a new graph.
        * Add an edge between any two nodes corresponding to adjacent faces.

    2.  **Define the Energy Function:** A graph cut algorithm minimizes an energy function with two parts:
        * **Data Cost (How well a face fits a segment):** This is the cost for assigning a face `f` to a specific rigid segment `s`. You are already calculating the "affinity" for this! You can define the cost as the inverse of your affinity score. For each face, you will have a cost to belong to *every* one of the rigid segments.
            * *For Limbs (Harmonic Distance):* `cost(f, s) = 1.0 - affinity_harmonic(f, s)`
            * *For Torso (Euclidean Distance):* `cost(f, s) = distance_euclidean(f, s)`
        * **Smoothness Cost (The penalty for cutting between two faces):** This is the cost of the edge between two adjacent faces, `f1` and `f2`. This cost encourages the final segmentation boundaries to follow natural creases. A great way to define this is using the dihedral angle between the faces.
            * `smoothness_cost(f1, f2) = exp( -(dihedral_angle^2) / (2 * sigma^2) )`
            * `sigma` is a small constant you can tune (e.g., 0.1). If the angle is large (a crease), the cost is low, making it "cheap" to cut there. If the angle is small (a flat area), the cost is high, making it "expensive" to cut.

    3.  **Solve with Graph Cut:** Use a multi-label graph cut library (e.g., gco-v3.0, which is popular in computer vision and graphics research) to solve this energy minimization problem. The library will take your data costs and smoothness costs and give you back the optimal label (rigid segment ID) for every face.

* **Benefit for Your Report:** This is a major upgrade. You can state that you replaced the heuristic watershed approach with a globally optimal segmentation based on graph-cut energy minimization, a state-of-the-art technique for this problem class.

Of course. Here are two distinct implementation pipelines based on your request.

### Pipeline 1: Optimal Segmentation with Graph Cuts

This pipeline implements the `Improvement 1` suggestion from `#file:improvement1.md` to replace the current watershed segmentation with a more robust, globally optimal method using graph cuts.

**Step 1: Add Graph-Cut Library**

First, you need a multi-label graph-cut library. As suggested in the document, **gco-v3.0** is a good choice.
1.  Download the library and add its source files to your project.
2.  Update your build system (e.g., CMakeLists.txt or Visual Studio project settings) to include the library's header files.

**Step 2: Create a New Menu Option and Function**

To compare this new method with the old one, add a new entry to the main menu that calls a new function, `visualizeGraphCutSegmentation`.

````cpp
// ...existing code...
19. Visualize Mesh Components (Colored Vertex Clusters)
20. Harmonic Function Surface Segmentation
21. Analyze Skeletal Segments (Diagnostic)
22. Detailed Rigidity Analysis (Debug Cutting)
23. Optimal Segmentation (Graph-Cut) // New menu option
--- LIBIGL ENHANCED FEATURES ---
// ...existing code...
void visualizeSkeletalKMeansClustering();
void visualizeGraphCutSegmentation(); // New function declaration
void testHarmonicSurfaceSegmentation();
// ...existing code...
        case 22:
            analyzeDetailedRigidity();
            break;
        case 23:
            visualizeGraphCutSegmentation();
            break;
        case 0:
            exit(0);
// ...existing code...
````

**Step 3: Implement the Graph-Cut Segmentation Logic**

This new function will contain the core logic. It reuses the skeleton refinement from the previous method but replaces the vertex assignment part.

````cpp
// ...existing code...
void visualizeSkeletalKMeansClustering() {
    // This function remains as your "before" comparison
    // ...
}

/**
 * Perform optimal surface segmentation using graph cuts.
 * This implements a simplified CRF model inspired by Kalogerakis et al.
 */
void visualizeGraphCutSegmentation() {
    if (!g_segmentation_result.success || g_segmentation_result.partialSkeleton.empty() || !g_mesh) {
        cout << "Error: Full segmentation must be performed first (Option 8)." << endl;
        return;
    }
    cout << "\n=== OPTIMAL SEGMENTATION (GRAPH-CUT) ===" << endl;
    clearVisualization();

    // --- Part 1: Reuse existing logic to get rigid segments ---
    // (This part is identical to the start of visualizeSkeletalKMeansClustering)
    // You should consider moving this logic into a shared helper function.
    cout << "Step 1: Splitting skeleton into rigid parts..." << endl;
    // ... (Copy the code from visualizeSkeletalKMeansClustering that generates `rigidSegments`)
    // ...
    cout << "Total rigid segments for labeling: " << rigidSegments.size() << endl;

    // --- Part 2: Define Energy Function and Run Graph-Cut ---
    cout << "Step 2: Defining energy function for graph-cut..." << endl;
    int numFaces = g_mesh->faces.size();
    int numLabels = rigidSegments.size();

    // Data Cost: Cost of assigning each face to each label
    auto* data = new GCoptimization::CostType[numFaces * numLabels];
    // ... Calculate data costs for each face and each label ...
    // You can average the vertex-based affinity from the old method for each face.

    // Smoothness Cost: Penalty for different labels on adjacent faces
    auto* smooth = new GCoptimization::CostType[numLabels * numLabels];
    // ... Calculate smoothness cost between labels, e.g., a simple Potts model (cost is 0 if labels are same, 1 otherwise) ...

    cout << "Step 3: Constructing graph and running solver..." << endl;
    try {
        GCoptimizationGeneralGraph *gc = new GCoptimizationGeneralGraph(numFaces, numLabels);
        gc->setDataCost(data);
        gc->setSmoothCost(smooth);

        // Set up graph neighborhood (face adjacency)
        // ... For each face i, find its adjacent faces j and call gc->setNeighbors(i, j) ...

        gc->expansion(2); // Run alpha-expansion

        // --- Part 4: Visualize Results ---
        cout << "Step 4: Visualizing graph-cut segmentation..." << endl;
        vector<int> faceLabels(numFaces);
        for (int i = 0; i < numFaces; i++) {
            faceLabels[i] = gc->whatLabel(i);
        }
        // ... New visualization code to color mesh faces based on `faceLabels` ...

        delete gc;
        delete[] data;
        delete[] smooth;
    } catch (GCException e){
        e.Report();
    }
    cout << "=== GRAPH-CUT SEGMENTATION COMPLETE ===" << endl;
}
