Of course. It's a very common and insightful observation that geometric algorithms which look perfect in a paper's figures can have tricky edge cases in practice. Your suspicion is likely correct: the issue of skeleton parts going outside the mesh is a known challenge, especially when using centroids of isocurves on concave or complex shapes.

Let's break down why this happens and how the papers you've found offer excellent, practical solutions that you can integrate within a few days.

### Diagnosis: Why Skeletons Go Outside the Mesh

[cite_start]The method in the "Pairwise Harmonics" paper generates skeletal segments by connecting the **centroids of the isocurves**[cite: 280, 283]. For a C-shaped or U-shaped part (like a flexed arm or the space between fingers), the geometric centroid of the points forming that curve will naturally fall *outside* the actual mesh volume, in the empty space of the concavity. Connecting these external centroids creates bones that are visibly outside the model.

The papers you've found, especially "Predicting Animation Skeletons for 3D Articulated Models via Volumetric Nets" by Xu et al., directly address this problem with very robust techniques.

Here are two novel approaches you can try, focusing on integrating ideas from these papers to fix your current implementation.

### Approach 1: Adopt a More Robust Skeleton Construction (Inspired by Xu et al.)

This is the most direct fix for your problem. Instead of simply connecting centroids, you can replace your skeleton construction step with a more robust pipeline inspired by Xu et al. This doesn't require retraining your GNN; it just changes what you do with the joints after you've identified them.

**Concept:** You will still use your existing method to find initial joint locations (the centroids from the harmonic isocurves). However, you will then connect them using a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** whose connection costs are penalized for going outside the mesh.

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  [cite_start]**Compute a Signed Distance Function (SDF):** For your input mesh, compute a volumetric SDF on a grid (e.g., 88x88x88 as in the paper)[cite: 966, 1002]. The SDF will give you a value for every point in the grid: negative if inside the mesh, positive if outside, and zero on the surface. This is your "inside/outside" checker.

2.  **Refine Joint Positions (Optional but Recommended):** A simple centroid might be outside the mesh. Before connecting them, project each joint position to a better location. A simple fix is to search in a small radius around your calculated centroid for the grid point with the most negative SDF value, pulling it back inside the mesh.

3.  **Implement a Cost-Based Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):**
    * Create a fully connected graph where every joint you've found is a node.
    * [cite_start]The core idea from Xu et al. is to define the cost of an edge between two joints (a potential bone) based on the path it takes through the volume[cite: 1060]. You will use your SDF to do this.
    * **Define the Edge Cost:** For an edge between joint `i` and joint `j`, trace the straight line segment between them through your SDF grid. The cost of this edge will be:
        * `Cost(i, j) = Length(i, j) + Penalty`
        * The `Penalty` is calculated by summing the SDF values of the voxels the line passes through. Crucially, if a voxel is outside the mesh (SDF > 0), you add a very large penalty value. [cite_start]The paper suggests setting the cost to a large number for any voxels outside the shape[cite: 1069].
    * This cost function heavily penalizes any bone that tries to leave the mesh volume.

4.  [cite_start]**Extract the Final Skeleton:** Run Prim's algorithm [cite: 1070] on your graph of joints using this new cost function. The result will be a tree of connections (your final skeleton) that is strongly encouraged to stay within the object's volume.

**Why this works:** This approach directly tackles the problem by making it computationally "expensive" for a bone to exist outside the mesh. The MST provides a principled way to find the best-connected tree structure under this constraint.
