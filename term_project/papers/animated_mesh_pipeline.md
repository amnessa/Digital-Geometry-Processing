Of course. Here is a clear, basic pipeline for the animated mesh project. This plan uses the tools you have already built (your CRF segmentation) and is achievable in your remaining time.

### Project Pipeline: Consistent Segmentation for Animated Meshes

The core strategy is: **Segment Once, Propagate to All Frames, then Analyze.**

-----

#### **Step 1: Create the "Master" Segmentation**

This is the only time you run your expensive segmentation algorithm.

  * [cite\_start]**Input:** A single, high-quality **reference mesh** (, `horse-gallop-reference.off`)[cite: 485].
  * **Process:** Run your CRF-based segmentation on this single mesh.
  * **Output:** A set of labels, one for each vertex, that defines the character's parts (e.g., `Vertex 1 -> Torso`, `Vertex 500 -> Hand`(or 500 to certain label(x))). This is your master blueprint.

-----

#### **Step 2: Propagate the Segmentation (The Tracking Step)**

This step applies your master blueprint to the entire animation sequence instantly.

  * **Input:**
    1.  The master labels from Step 1.
    2.  The full animation sequence (e.g., all 48 `horse-gallop-*.off` files). (horse-gallop-01.off to horse-gallop-48.off)
  * **Process:** For each frame of the animation, apply the master labels directly to the corresponding vertices. Since vertex \#500 is always the same point on the horse's skin, it always gets the "Hand" or some certain label(x) label. This is a simple data-copying operation.
  * **Output:** A sequence of animated meshes where the segmentation colors are perfectly stable and do not flicker.

-----

#### **Step 3: Analyze Segment Rigidity (The "Proof")**

Here you quantitatively prove that the parts you segmented are actually rigid.

  * **Input:** The consistently segmented animation sequence from Step 2.
  * **Process:**
    1.  For each colored segment (like the lower-left leg), pick a few random pairs of vertices inside it.
    2.  Measure the 3D distance between these pairs in the first frame.
    3.  Measure how much that distance changes in all the other frames.
  * **Output:** A "non-rigidity score" for each segment. You will find that bones have a very low score, while areas covering joints have a high score.

-----

#### **Final Deliverable**

Combine everything into a final result for your report and presentation.

  * **Create a side-by-side video:** Show the original animation next to your consistently segmented version.
  * **Include your analysis:** Present the chart of non-rigidity scores to provide data that backs up your visual results.

This pipeline directly addresses the challenge of tracking segments on a deforming mesh, uses your existing work, and is a complete, impressive story for a final project report.
