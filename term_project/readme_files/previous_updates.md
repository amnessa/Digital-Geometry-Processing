Key Changes Made and Their Impact
1. Reduced FPS Sample Count (Parameter Tuning)
Impact: 66% reduction in candidate segments. This directly addressed the "too many segments" problem by starting with a more manageable pool.

2. Added Aggressive Quality Pre-filtering
Impact: Only high-quality segments enter the selection pool. This eliminated weak, fragmented segments that were creating the "spaghetti" effect.

3. Much More Aggressive Overlap Detection
Impact: This was CRITICAL. The algorithm now catches segments that are running parallel to each other (like multiple segments along the same limb) and removes duplicates much more aggressively.

4. Complete Limb Segment Extraction (Algorithm Fix)
Impact: This follows the paper's actual algorithm instead of over-segmenting. Creates complete limb segments instead of fragments.

5. Improved Endpoint Constraint
Impact: Ensures skeletal paths actually reach the extremities (limb tips) instead of stopping short.

6. Anatomical Boundary Detection
Impact: More intelligent detection of where limbs should terminate and connect to the torso.

7. Reduced Maximum Skeleton Segments
Impact: Forces the algorithm to be more selective, keeping only the most important anatomical segments.

How These Changes Solved the "Spaghetti Skeleton" Problem
Before (Spaghetti Skeleton):
190 candidate segments from 20 FPS points
Weak overlap detection allowing many parallel segments
Over-segmentation at every rigidity change
No quality filtering â†’ many poor segments entered selection
Result: 8+ overlapping, fragmented segments
After (Clean Anatomical Skeleton):
66 candidate segments from 12 FPS points
Aggressive overlap detection removing duplicates
Complete limb segments instead of fragments
Quality pre-filtering eliminates weak candidates
Result: 4-6 clean, non-overlapping anatomical segments
The Critical Insight
The biggest breakthrough was realizing that the paper's algorithm is supposed to generate complete anatomical paths (like "hand to shoulder" or "foot to hip"), not fragments cut at every low-rigidity point. The over-aggressive rigidity-based cutting was creating many small pieces instead of coherent limb structures.

Next Steps for Further Improvement
Now that you have a solid foundation, here are the logical next steps:

Immediate Testing (Recommended)
Test this on 2-3 different models to ensure robustness before moving to advanced methods.

Advanced Method 1: GNN Implementation (#file:GNN_implement.md)
Replace PCA-based rigidity with learned features
Potentially handles complex shapes better (teddy bear torso problem)
Requires dataset preparation and training
Advanced Method 2: MST-Based Skeleton Construction (#file:more_robust_method.md)
Addresses the "skeleton outside mesh" problem using Signed Distance Functions
More robust connection strategy using Minimum Spanning Tree
Prevents bones from going through empty space in concave shapes
Both advanced methods would build on your current solid foundation, addressing different aspects:

GNN: Better junction detection
MST: Better skeleton connectivity within mesh volume
