# Pairwise Harmonics Segmentation - Cleaned Project Structure

## Overview
This document describes the cleaned-up project structure focused on implementing the pairwise harmonics segmentation algorithm as described in the paper "Pairwise Harmonics for Shape Analysis".

## What Was Removed
The following unnecessary components from the original project were removed:

1. **Patch Visualization Functions**:
   - `computeAndVisualizePatches()`
   - `findOptimalLoopOrder()`
   - All patch-related visualization code

2. **Symmetry Detection Functions**:
   - `computeAndVisualizeSymmetry()` (will be re-implemented as part of segmentation)
   - Complex symmetry voting mechanisms (simplified for testing)

3. **Redundant Geodesic Functions**:
   - `visualizeGeodesicPath()` (kept basic geodesic computation in Mesh class)
   - Complex path intersection analysis

4. **Old Assignment-Specific Code**:
   - Assignment 2 specific functions
   - Legacy visualization methods

## What Was Kept and Organized

### Core Classes (unchanged):
- `Mesh` class with geodesic computation and FPS
- `Painter` class for visualization
- `PairwiseHarmonics` class in helpers.h

### New Organized Menu Structure:
1. **Load mesh** - Load and prepare mesh for analysis
2. **Test cotangent Laplacian computation** - Verify the L matrix computation
3. **Test pairwise harmonic functions** - Compute and visualize harmonic fields between two vertices
4. **Compute farthest point sampling (FPS)** - Generate sample points for segmentation
5. **Test iso-curve extraction** - Extract and visualize iso-curves from harmonic fields
6. **Test rigidity analysis** - Analyze skeletal segments using PCA-based rigidity scores
7. **Visualize skeletal segments** - Show computed skeletal segments with rigidity coloring
8. **Perform complete segmentation** - Full segmentation algorithm (to be implemented)
9. **Exit**

### Global State Management:
- `g_fps_samples` - Stores computed FPS points
- `g_skeletal_segments` - Stores skeletal segment endpoint pairs
- `g_rigidity_scores` - Stores rigidity scores for each segment
- `g_harmonics` - PairwiseHarmonics instance for the current mesh

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Testing Individual Components
Use menu options 1-7 to test and verify each component of the algorithm:

1. **Load a mesh** (option 1)
2. **Test Laplacian computation** (option 2) - Verify the cotangent weights are computed correctly
3. **Test harmonic functions** (option 3) - Verify harmonic fields are computed and visualized correctly
4. **Generate FPS samples** (option 4) - Create sample points for skeletal segment generation
5. **Test iso-curves** (option 5) - Verify iso-curve extraction works
6. **Test rigidity analysis** (option 6) - Verify PCA-based rigidity computation
7. **Visualize segments** (option 7) - See the computed skeletal segments

### Phase 2: Complete Algorithm Implementation
Option 8 will implement the full segmentation pipeline:

1. **Stage 1**: Generate potential skeletal segments using FPS and pairwise harmonics
2. **Stage 2**: Rigidity analysis and partial skeleton construction
3. **Stage 3**: Initial segmentation based on partial skeleton
4. **Stage 4**: Skeleton completion and segmentation refinement

## Key Benefits of This Structure

1. **Modularity**: Each component can be tested independently
2. **Debugging**: Easy to isolate issues in specific parts of the algorithm
3. **Visualization**: Each step provides visual feedback
4. **Incremental Development**: Build up to full segmentation step by step
5. **Parameter Tuning**: Easy to experiment with different parameters for each component

## Usage Instructions

1. Compile the project using the existing CMakeLists.txt
2. Run the executable
3. Start with option 1 to load a mesh (use "default" for the pre-configured man0.off)
4. Progress through options 2-7 to test each component
5. Use option 8 when ready to test the complete segmentation

## Files Structure
- `main_segmentation.cpp` - Cleaned main file with organized menu
- `main.cpp` - Original file (kept as backup)
- `Mesh.h/cpp` - Core mesh functionality
- `helpers.h/cpp` - PairwiseHarmonics class and utilities
- `Painter.h/cpp` - Visualization utilities

This structure provides a solid foundation for implementing and testing the pairwise harmonics segmentation algorithm systematically.
