Of course. Let's construct the definitive 15-minute video presentation plan. This version will strictly adhere to your lecturer's "Describe -> Code -> Output" structure for every feature and will provide a much more detailed explanation of the "Full Segmentation" and "Optimal Segmentation" features, highlighting the technical depth of your work.

### **Video Presentation Scenario (Final, Code-Focused Version)**

**Introduction (1:00 minute)**

* **(Visual):** Start with a title slide: "An Advanced System for 3D Mesh Segmentation and Analysis." Show your best final segmentation result (the graph-cut horse or human) on the slide.
* **(Speech):** "Hello, my name is [Your Name], and this is my term project for CENG 789. The goal was to first implement the mesh segmentation pipeline from the 2013 paper 'Pairwise Harmonics for Shape Analysis', and then to improve upon its limitations using modern techniques to achieve more robust and semantically meaningful results. In this video, I will walk through each key feature of my program, explaining the C++ code responsible and showing the resulting 3D output."

**Part 1: Foundational Tools (3:30 minutes)**

**(1:00 - 2:00) Feature 1: Mesh Loading and Preparation (Menu 1)**

* **1. Describe:** "The first step in the pipeline is to load a 3D model. My system reads standard OFF files, then immediately converts the geometry into the matrix-based formats required by the LibIGL library for all subsequent high-performance computations."
* **2. Explain Code:**
    * **(Visual):** Show `Mesh.cpp`.
    * **(Speech):** "The process is handled by two functions in `Mesh.cpp`. First, `loadOff` is a straightforward parser that reads the vertex and face data into standard vectors. More importantly, `convertToLibIGL` then populates two Eigen matrices: `V` for vertex positions and `F` for face indices. This matrix structure is the fundamental input for nearly all LibIGL functions, making the rest of the pipeline efficient."
* **3. Show Output:**
    * **(Visual):** Load the `Armadillo.off` mesh. Show the 3D model in the viewer and point to the console output confirming the number of vertices and the successful conversion.

**(2:00 - 3:00) Feature 2: Cotangent Laplacian (Menu 3)**

* **1. Describe:** "The mathematical heart of the entire project is the **Cotangent Laplacian**. This is a 'geometry-aware' operator that is essential for computing smooth harmonic functions across the mesh surface, as described in the paper."
* **2. Explain Code:**
    * **(Visual):** Show `helpers_clean.cpp`.
    * **(Speech):** "The computation is encapsulated in the `computeCotangentLaplacianLibigl` function. The core of this function is a single, powerful line: `igl::cotmatrix(V, F, L);` [cite: term_project/helpers_clean.cpp]. This LibIGL function takes the vertex and face matrices we just prepared and computes the sparse Laplacian matrix `L`, which encodes the geometric relationships between all vertices."
* **3. Show Output:**
    * **(Visual):** Run the test. Point to the console output confirming the successful and rapid computation of the Laplacian matrix.

**(3:00 - 4:30) Feature 3: Enhanced Farthest Point Sampling (Menu 15)**

* **1. Describe:** "To find the extremities of a shape for skeletonization, we use Farthest Point Sampling. I implemented an enhanced version using heat-based geodesics, which is more accurate and significantly faster than repeated Dijkstra pathfinding."
* **2. Explain Code:**
    * **(Visual):** Show `Mesh.cpp` and the `farthestPointSamplingLibIGL` function.
    * **(Speech):** "The logic is in `farthestPointSamplingLibIGL`. First, we pre-compute the heat geodesic data structure with `igl::heat_geodesic::HeatGeodesicData`. Then, inside the main sampling loop, instead of a slow search, we just call `data.compute_distance` to instantly get the distances from the last chosen point to all others [cite: term_project/Mesh.cpp]. We pick the farthest one and repeat."
* **3. Show Output:**
    * **(Visual):** Run Option 15 on the Armadillo. Show the colored spheres appearing on the tips of the model's feet, nose, and tail, proving the method correctly identifies the extremities.

**Part 2: The Segmentation Engines (7:30 minutes)**

**(4:30 - 7:00) Feature 4: Full Segmentation - The Paper's Method (Menu 8)**

* **1. Describe:** "This feature is my implementation of the complete, multi-stage segmentation algorithm as described in the original 'Pairwise Harmonics' paper. It's a 'propose-and-filter' approach. It first generates hundreds of candidate skeletal segments, scores them based on a 'rigidity' metric, and finally uses a greedy algorithm to select a good, non-overlapping set to form the final skeleton and segmentation."
* **2. Explain Code:**
    * **(Visual):** Show `PairwiseHarmonicsSegmentation.cpp` and the main `performFullSegmentation` function.
    * **(Speech):** "The process is orchestrated here, in `performFullSegmentation`.
        * First, this nested loop `for (int i = 0; i < fps_samples.size(); ++i)` iterates through pairs of the FPS points we just generated to create candidate segments [cite: term_project/PairwiseHarmonicsSegmentation.cpp].
        * Inside, the call to `analyzeSkeletalSegment`, located in `RigidityAnalysis.cpp`, does the heavy lifting. It computes a harmonic field, extracts isocurves, and calculates the segment's average rigidity score.
        * Finally, this block of code implements the greedy selection. It sorts all the candidate segments by their rigidity score and iterates through them, adding a segment to the final skeleton only if it doesn't overlap with already chosen segments. The result is a partial skeleton representing the object's core structure."
* **3. Show Output:**
    * **(Visual):** Run option 8 on the Armadillo. Show the resulting yellow skeleton overlaid on the mesh. Then, run option 19 (`Visualize Mesh Components`) to show the final surface segmentation derived from it. Point out that while it captures the main parts, the boundaries between segments can be somewhat jagged. This motivates the need for a better method.

**(7:00 - 12:00) Feature 5: Optimal Segmentation - My Contribution (Menu 23) - **THE MAIN EVENT***

* **1. Describe:** "The previous method's noisy boundaries are a result of its heuristic, greedy nature. My main contribution is a complete replacement of that final stage with a modern, principled energy minimization framework. This feature, **Optimal Segmentation**, reformulates the problem as a Conditional Random Field solved with graph cuts. Instead of making local, greedy choices, it finds the globally optimal label for every single face on the mesh simultaneously."
* **2. Explain Code:**
    * **(Visual):** Open `VisualizationUtils.cpp` and scroll to the `visualizeGraphCutSegmentation` function. This is your most important code explanation.
    * **(Speech):** "The core of this entire feature is the design of a custom energy function, which is computed inside this large loop iterating over every face. The function has two parts:
        * **Part A: The Data Cost.** This is the cost of assigning a face to a particular segment. My key innovation is a *hybrid* data cost.
            * **For Limbs:** In this `if` block (`if (rigidSeg.sourceIdx >= 0)`), the cost is a weighted sum: `harmonic_cost + lambda * euclidean_cost` [cite: VisualizationUtils.cpp]. `harmonic_cost` attracts the face to its correct limb, while `euclidean_cost` acts as a spatial penalty to prevent segments from stealing distant faces.
            * **For the Torso:** This `else` block is my custom solution to the biggest flaw in naive implementations, where the torso claims parts of the face or hands. The torso's cost is calculated entirely differently. I compute the `min_dist_to_limb_tip`, and the cost becomes an exponential function of that distance: `exp(-alpha * normalized_dist)` [cite: VisualizationUtils.cpp]. This creates a 'repulsion field' around the extremities, protecting them from the torso and ensuring a much more semantically correct result.
        * **Part B: The Smoothness Cost.** After the data cost, we need clean boundaries. This is handled inside the ICM solver loop. This line, `energy += smoothnessPenalty;`, adds a small penalty whenever two adjacent faces have different labels. This encourages the final cuts to be smooth and follow the natural creases of the model."
* **3. Show Output:**
    * **(Visual):** Run this on the **human** model. Show the final, clean segmentation. The separation of the head, torso, arms, and legs should be very clear. **Show a side-by-side screenshot comparing this result to the output from Feature 4 (Menu 19) to visually prove how much cleaner your boundaries are.**

**Part 3: Final Proof and Conclusion (2:30 minutes)**

**(12:00 - 13:30) Feature 6: Robustness on Animated Meshes (Menu 26 & 27)**

* **1. Describe:** "To prove the stability and practical value of my optimal segmentation, I tested it on a full animation sequence. The system first generates the segmentation and binds a skeleton on a reference pose. Then, it deforms that skeleton frame-by-frame without ever re-calculating the segmentation, proving its temporal coherence."
* **2. Explain Code:**
    * **(Visual):** Show `AnimatedMeshPipeline.cpp`.
    * **(Speech):** "The `bindSkeleton` function runs once, using Bounded Biharmonic Weights to compute skinning weights. Then, for every frame, the `deformSkeleton` function uses these weights in a standard Linear Blend Skinning algorithm to move the skeleton with the deforming mesh [cite: term_project/AnimatedMeshPipeline.cpp]. The crucial point is that the segmentation colors, the labels, are assigned only once and remain fixed."
* **3. Show Output:**
    * **(Visual):** Play your pre-recorded video of the running horse. Point out how the colored segments for the legs, head, and torso are perfectly stable and do not flicker or change, even as the mesh deforms significantly.

**(13:30 - 15:00) Conclusion & Summary**

* **(Visual):** Show your title slide again with your best result.
* **(Speech):** "In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates a complete pipeline for advanced 3D mesh segmentation. My main contributions are:
    * First, the complete implementation of the foundational 'Pairwise Harmonics' algorithm.
    * Second, a significant improvement to the segmentation logic using a **Graph-Cut based energy minimization** which produces globally optimal, clean boundaries.
    * Third, a **novel hybrid cost function** that effectively solves the critical torso-overreach problem present in simpler implementations.
    * And finally, a demonstration of the system's temporal stability and robustness through the **animated mesh pipeline**.

    Thank you."
