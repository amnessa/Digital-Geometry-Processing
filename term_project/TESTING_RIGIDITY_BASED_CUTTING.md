# Testing the Updated Rigidity-Based Skeletal Segmentation

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Rigidity-Based Segment Cutting**:
   - Added `extractRigidityBasedSegments()` method
   - Segments are now cut when rigidity drops below threshold (0.7)
   - Low-rigidity areas become junction points

2. **Lower Rigidity Threshold**:
   - Changed from 0.9 to 0.7 for more sensitive junction detection
   - Should better identify joints and connections between body parts

3. **Multiple Segments per FPS Pair**:
   - A single harmonic field between two FPS points can now generate multiple segments
   - Segments are separated by low-rigidity junctions

4. **Diagnostic Analysis**:
   - Added option 20 to analyze skeletal segments
   - Helps identify if segments are starting from same points

## Testing Protocol:

1. **Load a mesh** (Option 1): Try `man0.off` or `Armadillo.off`
2. **Run full segmentation** (Option 7): Use default parameters first
3. **Analyze segments** (Option 20): Check for issues with segment generation
4. **Visualize results** (Option 18 or 19): See if segments are more diverse

## Expected Improvements:

- **Diverse starting points**: Segments should start from different locations
- **Shorter segments**: Cut at junctions instead of spanning entire limbs
- **Better anatomical correspondence**: High-rigidity areas should define limb centers
- **Junction detection**: Low-rigidity areas should separate segments

## Debug Questions to Answer:

1. Are segments still starting from the same point?
2. Are segments being cut at low-rigidity junctions?
3. Do different FPS pairs generate different segment patterns?
4. Is the rigidity threshold appropriate (0.7)?

Run the program and follow the testing protocol above.
